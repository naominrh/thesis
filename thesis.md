## Abstract

## Introduction
Once upon a time, dinosaurs walked this Earth. It is said that they too were already infected by the omnipresent HBV. Truly incredible!
- Blood brain barrier formation relies on WNT7...most likely....i am not allowed to say too much here
Hier ist der Text der Einleitung
Very boring but important
In this part, the background will be explained!
We will have a lot of stuff here:

Antibiotic resistance is fueling a growing global health crisis, necessitating the discovery of antibacterial compounds with
novel modes of action (MoAs). The decline in new antibiotic approvals, coupled with the rise of multi-resistant pathogens,
highlights the limitations of traditional antibiotic drug discovery. Among them, phenotypic drug screening has proven effective 
at identifying antibacterial compounds, but requires time-consuming follow-up experiments to determine drug MoA or targets. 
Here, we will outline a project aiming to develop a streamlined workflow for predicting antibiotic MoAs from automated microscopy
imaging data analyzed by deep learning. The project is based on the hypothesis that MoAs of chemical compounds can be predicted 
by computationally matching their induced phenotypes to those of genetic mutants. In order to map the phenotypes of essential 
genes, we use a CRISPRi technique allowing to induce their repression in a finely tuned manner. We will report on our early 
efforts to create and phenotype these inducible mutants in E. coli. This work contributes to the establishment of a pipeline that 
will accelerate the search for novel antibiotics against antimicrobial resistant bacteria.

### Motivation

### Demotivation


## Material and Methods

This is the glorious introduction of my thesis which will blow your mind.

## Theory
- Take a look at the WNT7 receptors they gotta do something 

Die Theorie von RL macht Spaß!

The very complicated theory is hard to understand but I manage to break it down such that it will be easy to understand.

## Experiment
loli pop
Here, we will have the hypothesis later on.
Interesting but inconclusive

## Results

## Experimental section

## Discussion

The experiment will have partly really good results but also partly some results which we did not expect.

## Conclusion
I did a great job!
I literally analyzed every single HBV capsid! Crown me, don't clown me!

## References

## Appendix
We need some additional data here.

Thanks for the cake
